# LegoNMC
#### Adds a couple of cool features to NameMC

#### Only works on Chrome for now, will update l8tr (or not)
#### Only doing ZIP for now, I am not paying 5$ for this.

# Download:
Click on the green Code button, download ZIP then once downloaded, unzip the file.
Go to chrome://extensions
Click on developer mode then load unpacked and select the folder

If this worked, you should see a LegoNMC by i4g credit at the bottom of your namemc page
