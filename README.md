# LegoNMC

#### Adds a couple of cool features to NameMC

#### Only doing ZIP for Chrome, I am not paying 5$ for this.

#### Firefox version coming soon

# Download:

Click on the green Code button, download ZIP then once downloaded, unzip the file.

Go to chrome://extensions

Click on developer mode then load unpacked and select the folder

If this worked, you should see a LegoNMC by i4g credit at the bottom of your namemc page
